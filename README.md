## CAD_Swing_Arm

### Description
One of my goals in this class is to get ready to earn my Certified Onshape Associate certification. In preparation to doing the test I have taken a drawing of a swing arm. This assignment will help me determine what additional concepts I need to focus on for the certification exam. Single or double sided mechanical device which attaches the rear wheel of a motorcycle to its body, allowing it to pivot vertically.

### Reflection
The hardest part about the swing arm was where to start. All you get to start out with is a couple drawing of the thing you are making. So Mr. H told me to make sure you constrain everything before dimensioning everything. Also look at the details. One thing I messed up was that I thought there was a hole that went all the way through in the middle but it turns out it doesnt.



## Pull_Copter

### Description
In this unit, we are going to design a fun little helicopter toy, called a "Pull Copter," composed of five parts.  If you had to model all five parts yourself, that would take way too long.  But with a partner, you only have to model half of the parts! For this aasignment you are tasked to use a partner to make these five parts and be able to assemble them in Onshape. My partner is [Jabari](https://github.com/jbright91/CircuitPython.git)

> Mass of Prop: 1.544 g/mm cubed

### Reflection
The hardest part was getting the correct mass. Having a partner you might not be able to get the most accurate mass because you are not doing it for them. Instead You are having to ask them where they might have gone wrong. I learned how to fix this by helping my partner and understanding his part of the project and the same for him.

## Multi-Part_Design_Studios

### Description

> Question 4 Drawing Mass: 8568.11 g

### Reflection
The hardest part of this was trying to get the write mass after messing up. So what I would do is go back and double check making sure the dimensions were write. The I would look how much the mass was off by and that would tell me how big my mistake is. This solution seemed to work and I was able to get the correct mass.
